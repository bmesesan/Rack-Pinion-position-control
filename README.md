# Rack-Pinion-position-control
The project has been developed as a challenge for Stratec Biomedical Cluj Napoca hardware internship position.
The system transforms rotational movement into linear movement using a rack and pinion. The speed, position and acceleration are displayed in real time. The user can set a refference position and confirm it. A video demonstration has been done.
